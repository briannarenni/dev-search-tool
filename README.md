# Responsive GitHub User Search

Made with Svelte, Pico.css, and Lucide Icons ðŸ’œ

## Behavior & Features

- Light and dark mode based on user's system color scheme with additional toggle switch
- Loads Octocat's profile on initial load
- Shows dedicated messages if no user is found or a user has no bio
- If profile has no name, the username fills instead
- Other blank profile information shows as _N/A_
- Active links to a user's (valid) website, Twitter, or company Github profile

## Dev Notes

I've never used Svelte, so I wanted a simple project to dive into it with. Svelte's readability and intuitive syntax is very smooth to work with. The reactivity alone is a welcomed change for me.
